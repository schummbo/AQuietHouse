# A Quiet House

You recently decided to take on a new adventure and move to a small town and purchase an old home. The real estate agent mentioned that it is in a bit of a state of disrepair and needs renovation. And, unfortunately, the previous owner passed away and not much is known about them.

You don't have a huge budget but you're not afraid of getting your hands dirty.

Through some ingenuity, help from neighbors, and elbow grease, it could become quite a place to live.
